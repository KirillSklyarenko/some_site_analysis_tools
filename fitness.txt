"Bad Days" - What it Means When You Under-perform and How to Deal With Bad Training Days

what's up guys it's Bromley from Empire barbell and today I want to talk about bad days now we've all had bad training days and for some of you newer guys or you guys that follow let's say more instinctive or less structured training protocols it can seem a little chaotic it can seem like there's some type of intangible x-factor that's going to determine how good you are on any given day or maybe it just feels like you're at the mercy of the elements so if that's the case that is a clear-cut sign that you do not have a good handle on your training and you need to go back to square one either need to find somebody to mentor you or you need to find a program and stick your ass to it until you start progressing again so the key thing to know is that there is no amount of normal fluctuation in the human body that is going to overtake what a properly planned out and executed training program will account for it's if you do it right it's gonna count for recovery you're gonna have scheduled your heavy workout to in advance and you're going to build up to those very methodically and predictably so that you know exactly how much fatigue you're gonna have it that workout you're also going to plan your d load you're going to plan your resets so you do not push it into the red too often if you're having a little bit of confusion as to why you went in when you thought you were gonna have workout and you had a bad workout always assume that you made a bad training decision somewhere and that you are under a covered do not just look up to the heavens and say why today I was supposed to hit a big deadlift why today it's you it's your programming it's your poor planning its poor execution it's not taking into account recovery so here's a quick list of the things that pretty much everybody is guilty of that has led to a mysterious bad day so if you have that bad day always track back over the last let's say 1 to 2 weeks and take inventory of how your workouts went how you felt what the weight was did you hit any personal bests did you go above 90% did you handle more volume than you used to how are your workouts spaced apart how are you eating how are you sleeping those are the big questions you have to ask so number one the one everybody's guilty of pretty much all the time is going to heavy too often ok people look at heavy work as if it's just as good as isolation worker it's just as good as high rep work that there's somehow no difference there's actually a very big cost heavy work which is why you have to take the greatest pains to account for it in your training program okay people will get a training program that has them at let's say 70% for several weeks and they might get a hair up their ass and go to 90% just to see how it feels and they'll treat it like it's extra credit like you somehow wasn't a bad move on their part it takes a long time for it to really sink in to most people what the actual cost of that move is and why it's a bad idea you cannot go over 90% on the same lift multiple weeks in a row without backsliding also if you are following some type of program that accounts and put you on some type of natural progression up to those heavier percentages that probably means you're handling more volume early on which means if you go up to a heavier set you'll just get a compound that fatigue so if you're going off program that's number one if you don't have a program get a program there's a lot of ways to structure progressions there's plenty of people that have had success with a variety of styles and different flavors of progressions but they all type tend to follow the same type of principles and one of those principles is not blowing your wad on every single workout you have to prepare workout 1 prepares you for workout to workout 2 prepares prepares you for workout 3 maybe work out for you hit something big and then you dial it back and reset so I always like to go back to this color gradient I'm a fan of wave loading most training protocols follow some type of wave load whether you're talking about over a long period of time or a short period of time there's always some context of building up over time and then dropping back and resetting that theme is always present even if you're looking at something that's truly linear or undulating that sense of building up over time dropping back and building up again is always present so that's how I like to think of it so we start in the blue a little bit easier as the week's go on you work up you work up you don't get really into the red you don't get deep into the mud until several weeks in and you're only there for a short period of time before you drop back and build back up now that might be a hard reset to a lower percentage there might be a deal owed before you just repeat the same progression with heavier weight there's a lot of ways to do it but the key is you are accounting for these heavier workouts and you're not staying there very long and when you do hit your heaviest workouts it is always going to be followed by some period of reduced effort either reduce intensity or reduce volume something that allows recovery there's a reason we follow Peaks and tapers right before a beat and that's because it sets you up for a predictable spike in strength this is the same thing we're trying to do in the middle of our training cycles where we're trying to recover we're trying to get you to build up bigger and stronger so you can follow the next training block better than when you start it so if you're going heavy heavy heavy heavy heavy and you're not paying attention to the periods of recovery that you're missing out on it's no wonder that you're having more bad training days than good training days so that brings us to our next point which is little time in between workouts now this is between substantial workouts hard workouts so it doesn't always have to be heavy as at 90% and up it can be a workout where you handled a lot more volume that you used to it could be a workout that tacks you in some other way if you're looking at the distance between squat workouts if you're wondering why last week you hit this heavy squat and the next week you tanked it's not just the squatting but you have to look at the other things you did in between I do strongman so I have to think what tall do my farmer walk runs or my stone loading or my yoke walks or my truck pulls what cost does that have to my barbell list throughout the week I have to be aware of that I had a deadlift workout that was very taxing I didn't go very heavy it was just a lot of practice sets and it was more working sets that I typically do and it fried me for a couple days if I was slated for a big squat that week it would have suffered and that's something I have to know ahead of time as I'm planning out so don't just look at how heavy you're going look at how substantial the workouts are and how spread apart they are okay if you had a heavy squat workout followed by a heavy deadlift workout then three days later you tried to squat again and you're struggling there's your answer to many heavy lower body workout 2pac closely together same thing goes for say overhead pressing and benching same thing goes for working your upper back before you do pretty much anything else because everything requires your upper back to be fresh okay so pay attention to those training sessions and how closely they're stacked together so beyond training we look at what you're doing outside of training shitty sleep is a really big one it's really common around let's say the holidays to burn the candle it both Thins if you like to drink if you like to party if you like to stay up late and you got to be up early for work that is going to overtime put a big dent in your recovery capacity so again if you're charting more nights than not I'm getting six hours or less there's a good chance you're under recovered and a couple of good nights a heavy sleep before your next big workout are gonna be the thing that separates you from a good workout or a shitty workout caloric deficit also around the holidays that's a big one because people eat a lot of and they might be thinking they're getting their calories in but the chaos of the holidays could really throw people for a loop sometimes you can skip meals because you're getting ready for that big meal at the end of the day sometimes you can be feasting on holiday treats and maybe not get enough protein or get enough normal nutrients that you're used to eating throughout the day can really interrupt more regimented dietary habits if that's how you're used to structuring it so take a look back if you've had a really hard workout where you thought you should have had a good one aside from your training decisions and your sleep habits look at your diet if you have it man consistent with your food intake it's only going to take about three or four days of that before it really starts to disrupt your training so that's a really obvious one that people tend to look over especially since so many of us eat instinctively we don't plan out our meals we just bank on kind of eating the same stuff every day go into the same place getting about the same things so the holidays can really screw that up if you are having trouble putting it all together and you need a little bit of help if you're having more bad days than good days don't hesitate to reach out to me you can reach me on Instagram at Empire underscore barbell I am taking clients for mentorship it's a little bit more than your standard remote coaching deal I do try to build a close relationship with the people I work with I try to do as much personalization as I can and keep up with weekly drop-ins and video reviews so for that reason I always cap it at nine people and that's a promise I make to everyone I take and never go over nine people because once I get past that I can no longer coach you at that point I'm just sending a template to everybody in my email list so don't hesitate to leave a question in the comment box and don't hesitate to reach out to me thanks for watching guys until next time this is Bromley at Empire barbell I'll see you

3 Exercises for Strong, Healthy Shoulders
Eric Cressey T-Nation

1 – Landmine Press
https://youtu.be/gygpFvx_O3k

Landmine presses are an effective "middle of the road" exercise between overhead work and true horizontal pressing exercises.

If you really think about the arm path, this isn't much different than an incline press, so why does the incline press cause people more shoulder problems than landmine work? It has to do with the fact that having the upper back pinned against a bench limits the ability of the shoulder blades to freely rotate upward – they get stuck down into scapular downward rotation.

2 – Bottoms-Up Overhead Carry
https://youtu.be/Ch46ZRTrsR8

I like the idea of starting with a carry because it teaches you where an appropriate "finish" position is, and then you can work backwards from it.

3 – Bottoms-Up Military Press
https://youtu.be/eTanFoLRyL4

If you've successfully completed overhead carries, you can go to a one-arm bottoms-up kettlebell military press. The bottoms-up setup is more shoulder friendly because the unstable environment shifts more of the muscular contribution to joint stability than actual force production. This is great if you're rehabbing a bad shoulder.

Weakpoint Wednesday: Arms (Aesthetics)

frequency frequency frequency. Everytime I lowered arms frequency I stagnated, every time I upped the frequency they grew. My theory is there is only so much volume you can do in a session before you start getting diminishing returns and it's better to split total volume over a few days. With arms this is super true because they might get tired and weaker in one workout but recover pretty damn quickly. My best results came from doing something four days a week, either two arms days and two upper days, or one upper, one arm, one chest/bis and one back/tris.

also eating, I don't think my arms grew very much at all if I was cutting or maintaining, arms more than anything get bigger on a bulk.

Heavy lifting, doing doggcrapp style workouts for arms just doesn't work imo. Your biceps/tris are too weak to actually punish in one very heavy set of curls or whatever.

If I began to stall I either at more, or upped the weights or a combination of both. 90% of the time I superset arms (I don't like sitting around for 1-2 minutes just for my biceps) but to break a plateau I might do them separately and focus on lifting a little heavier and squeezing/contracting.

Looking back, what would you have done differently?

Direct arm work more often and more frequency. I've read tons of people say they don't need direct arm work and for me that was just never the case. I'm not sure if it's because I'm an ectomorph/naturally skinny guy with a lot of slow muscle fibers but I need direct arm work to grow. Everytime I bought into the whole "just do rows and bench and your arms will grow) they are shrunk/stayed the same, or if I was doing a heavy bulk they got a little bigger but exploded when I added in direct work.

I've noticed that naturally big guys tend to say bench/rows give them enough arm work but my theory is these are type 1 muscle fiber type guys that need more recovery between workouts, whereas us skinny guys with good recovery need more volume.

I'd say the biggest contributor is how much work I spend on various presses. Overhead, benching and dips, all siginificant contributors to my triceps, and since they make up 2/3 of the arm, they contribute greatly to size. That said, I do no direct tricep work, but that's because all the pressing seems to take care of it.

For biceps, whenever I try to go heavy on them, I eventually get pain. I imagine this is because strongman work is so bicep intensive that I can't double down with gym work. Instead, I like very light weight and high reps. Poundstone curls are a very regular feature in my training, and what I'm currently using, but I also like running the rack with DBs. I'll pick a rep range like 12, start with the lightest weight on the rack, do 12, move up to the next, do 12, repeat until I can't, then work back DOWN and go for 12s again. Makes light weight feel heavy.

Once you develop your strength more and train effectively, everything will grow. Despite what most say, I’ve always loved to include high volume isolation work, on both my biceps and triceps.

I also work my arms like any other muscle, by progressive overloading. I usually do one heavy workout(barbell or ez bar curl) then I go lighter with my dumbbell work. I rarely lift any dumbbells above 40 pounds.

With triceps I go lighter, but more reps. Close grip bench, dips, and strict push downs always do the trick. I mix it up, since my triceps are underpowered compared to my biceps.

Overall I love to focus on pumps, and go between 12-15 sets for both biceps and triceps twice a week. I don’t care what anyone says, isolation work pays off, especially if you’re training effectively.
